# Spam Mail Prediction

## Introduction

The "Spam Mail Prediction" dataset is a curated collection of emails that have been labeled as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). This dataset is designed for email classification, with a primary focus on predicting whether an incoming email is likely to be a spam message or a legitimate message.

### Objective

The primary objective of working with this dataset is to develop a predictive model capable of automatically classifying incoming emails as either spam or ham. This classification can be based on various factors such as the content of the email, specific features, or other relevant attributes. The ultimate goal is to create a robust model that can be seamlessly integrated into email clients or services, effectively filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful spam emails. By doing so, users can enjoy a more efficient and enjoyable email experience with a reduced risk of being exposed to malicious content.
